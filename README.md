# hello-world
Hi Guys! 



I'm a new 10 yr old kid who is trying to learn
programming using github. I havent got to the hard
parts yet, but i hope github helps :). Now right now
i am trying to create a software for shell shockers that
edits the html to give unlimited golden eggs + aimbot. 
The aimbot will be used from triston stuarts aimbot code.
The credits go to him btw.
